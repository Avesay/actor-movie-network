## Actor Movie Co-starring Network Analysis
This is a project created for a course at University of Nicosia. Its main goal is to construct an actor co-starring network, and analyze it, its communities and smaller genre networks.
### To run the project:

Currently it is not possible to run the code from the notebook, because the dataset used for creating the network is too large to upload. However, the results of each code cell should be visible when viewing the notebook.
